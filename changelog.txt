2.6
- status color values changed for better readability
- logo frame removed
- Fixed bug: 'Prio' cell not dimmed when row status == 'closed'
- user data (Notion access tokens / API keys) outsourced to new external script
  for easier setup and better maintainability (user.py)
- refactoring

2.5 
- regex pattern matching for status codes:
  Matches 'oXXX' & 'OXXX' for status 'open' ("[o|O]p?e?n?\Z")
  and equivalent for status 'closed' ("[c|C]l?o?s?e?d?\Z").
- added status 'in progress';
  matched by the status code itself or 'in progress' / 'ip' / 'i p' / 'IP' etc. ("[i|I]n?\s?[p|P]r?o?g?r?e?s?s?\Z")
- if any of the 3 status codes mentioned above and its variations is recognized in the Notion data,
  the corresponding status code and color will be displayed in the app (open, in progress, closed) and the row formatted accordingly
- not recognized status codes will be dimmed
--> significantly improves practical functionality
    (code shorts e.g. 'o' and 'c' in Notion can be used saving time while full status code will still be displayed in the app),
    reduces program code size and complexity
- code refactoring

2.4
- outputs 'nothing to see here' in bright_black in notes table when table is empty

2.3
- account for capitalized letters, i.e. "Open" & "open", "Closed" & "closed",
  since the web app may capitalize letters, or adjust for user preference
- does intentionally not sort tables by task numbers, because you may want to 
  custom sort tables with task numbers unrelated to the order of table items
- starboard written logo letters appear every refresh in random colors
